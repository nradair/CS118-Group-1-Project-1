# Project 1: gRPC

### Task

Create a gRPC server and client that successfully communicate with each other. [Handout is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kKzu7bQ8CPMh06ZE60QBgZjtddfJWKpjWUT6BRXP1vc/edit?usp=sharing).

### Goals

- Write a proto file that defines an RPC service
- Generate go files from your proto
- Send gRPC requests with client to server

### Requirements

To receive full credit for this lab, you must pass all the tests in <code>integration_test.go</code>. Please do not modify the test file. To submit your lab for grading, please upload to GradeScope. 

<h2>Part 1: Proto</h2>
